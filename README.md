## 🎉 Introduction

Welcome to ComfyUI SAM3! This application integrates Meta's SAM3 model into your ComfyUI workflows. With this tool, you can segment images simply by typing descriptions. No programming skills needed. 

### 📷 What is SAM3?

Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3) is an advanced tool that recognizes and separates various objects in images. You can instruct the model by entering natural language prompts like "cat" or "tree". This custom node pack enhances your ComfyUI experience by enabling features such as:

- Object segmentation based on your descriptions.
- Filtering results using a confidence threshold.
- Setting minimum object sizes for segmentation.
- Generating individual masks for each object.
- Creating a combined mask showing all objects at once.
- Visualizing results with overlays and labels.
